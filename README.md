# Heart Disease Prediction

This project is a machine learning application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. It leverages popular machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to achieve reliable predictions.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection and accurate diagnosis can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project utilizes supervised learning methods to analyze patient data and predict the presence of heart disease.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used contains several features relevant to cardiovascular health, such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type (cp)
- Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
- Serum cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting blood sugar (fbs)
- Resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)
- Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)
- Exercise-induced angina (exang)
- Oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise)
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels (ca)
- Thalassemia (thal)
- Target (0: No disease, 1: Disease)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest

## 🔍 Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using:

- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report
- Cross-validation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Run the Project
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart_disease_prediction.git


	2.	Navigate to the project folder.
	3.	Open the Jupyter Notebook file and run each cell.

📈 Results

The Random Forest model provided the highest accuracy among all tested algorithms, indicating its strong performance for this classification task.
